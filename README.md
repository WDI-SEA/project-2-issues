# PROJECT 2 ISSUES!
If you're having trouble with your project, open an issue on this repository, and follow the template to leave a detailed comment about your issue, an instructor will respond to you, and attempt to give you all the help you need! If your problem can't be resolved in a timely fashion through issue replies, we'll escalate to a zoom 1:1.

## Important To Remember
The more detailed you are, the easier it will be for us to diagnose your issue.

You can use three backtics (```) to create a code block, and three backtics at the end of the block to close it out. If you add js(```js), css(```css), or html(```html) to the opening set of backtics, it will color code your code block to make it look more like the language you're sharing. This helps us read your code, and it helps your issue look more professional, which will be an essential part of the job once you're in the field.

PATIENCE is key to successful development! We get it, you're stressed, you're overwhelmed, and this is the most important issue in your life right now, but taking a breath and stepping away for a minute can do you a world of good. A lot of times our brains go into overdrive when we're faced with a deadline, it's important to practice slowing down your thoughts, and deliberately using your analytical skills to overcome these hurdles.
